# Capstone-Project
The project aims to produce a device that will alert the pet whenever it enters â€œforbidden areas'' within the home, which are to be determined by the user. The project will consist of two parts; an intelligent, wearable, low-power master unit wearable by the pet, informed of the animal's location through tags to be placed within the home and alerting the pet whenever it intrudes into forbidden areas. The other part consists of tags to be placed inside the house. These tags are intended to be small and cooperate with the master unit to allow the device to work as intended.
